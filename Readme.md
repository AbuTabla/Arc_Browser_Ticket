I also noticed that when using this feature with a pre-existing "little window" already there, and entering an address, the old window is used. As the name suggests, it is called "new little window", so I expected there to be a new window opened. I am looking to build my portfolio/experience and was wondering if it's acceptable on your end for me to help try and resolve this bug.
